# Task Management App

## Goal
A simple, educational Blazor WebAssembly application for learning modern web development with C#.

## Description
This is a localhost-only task management app that allows users to create, view, and manage personal tasks.  
Each task has a name, description, and completion status. Users can mark tasks as complete/incomplete, delete tasks, and see their progress with a task counter.

## Key Features
- Display all tasks in a clean, card-based interface
- Toggle task completion with visual feedback (strikethrough for completed tasks)
- Delete unwanted tasks
- Real-time progress tracking ("X of Y tasks completed")
- Responsive Bootstrap styling

## Technical Focus
Built as a study project to learn Blazor component architecture, dependency injection, state management, and Razor syntax without the complexity of backend APIs or databases.  
All data is stored in memory during the browser session.

## Target Audience
Developers learning Blazor WASM, C# web development, and modern component-based UI patterns.
